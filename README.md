# greenland_flowlines
Makes flowlines from user input cross section and subset greenland velocity data from fastice. See example.png.

This script takes in subset velocity from the fastice MEaSUREs subsetting tool (https://github.com/fastice/GrIMPNotebooks) and creates flowlines the pass through points on a user-defined cross section. The flowlines are output to a shape file in the same format as the shape files from Felikson et al. (2020).
